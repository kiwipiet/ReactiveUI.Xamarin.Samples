ReactiveUI.Xamarin.Samples
==========================

### ReactiveUI.Xamarin.StockWatch.Advandced (support for Android 2.1)
Use my Branch "with_android_2.1_support" of Reactive UI. 
I linked the Projects in the ReactiveUI.Xamarin.Samples-Solution so 
you will have to pull these branch too.

The sample includes the following features:

- use AppBarCombat for tab navigation
- use rxUI-Routing for navigation
- supports the back-button for navigation
- handle configuration changes e.g. change of orientation
- reuse of existing views
